Hi all!

This is a blog dedicated to maths, statistics and elections.

Interested in politics, but far more interested in the numbers surrounding them. Developing a Bayesian model, using historical election and current polling data, using this to predict how individual areas and electorates will vote. I hope to predict the outcome of elections as early as possible on election night.
